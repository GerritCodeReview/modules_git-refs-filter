The change_notes should be always full for being effective.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"Unusually\" because usually un-accessed changes would not be loaded in the cache.\n\nSure, but it is unsafe to have a cache that is potentially too small, as you may be triggering lots of evictions of data that could be useful to be loaded in memory.\n\n\u003e \u003e \u003e Some installations might have set hard limits in how much this cache can grow, and thus using this lib module might lead to a higher number of evictions and memory (or disk) usage.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e If you have 100k changes and allocate less than 100k entries in the persistent cache, then you have a problem, yes.
