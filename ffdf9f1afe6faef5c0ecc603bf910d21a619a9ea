      "message": "Do you think that using parallel streams lead to worse performance in this case?\n\nThe overhead of managing different threads and results might be more expensive than doing the actual sequential work, but if the goal of this change is performance and resources, perhaps it is something that should be benchmarked and assessed (even as a follow up change).",
